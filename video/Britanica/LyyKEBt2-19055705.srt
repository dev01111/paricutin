1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This was once the site of a Teraskin-Indian community.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today, the streets, shops, and dwellings of more than 500 people lie buried beneath lava.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A short distance away, a steep-sided cinder cone marks

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the spot where Paricutín volcano heaved rock and ash from the earth for a period of 9 years.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In 1943 thick sticky lava, driven by large volumes of gas

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
exploded out of Paricutín's vents.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Material that was blasted into the air to cool and solidify.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Much of it fell around the vent, forming a cone-shaped mountain of cinders

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The rest, carried by wind, spread a choking blanket of ash and dust over an area of 25 square kilometers.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
At night, the fiery glow of falling cinders quickly showed the cone building,

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
while the lava that buried the village poured from several small vents around the base of the new mountain.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Paricutín erupted from a place where no volcano had been before.

13
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,100
Now it is dormant (extinct/inactive).

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,100
It's activity seems to have come to an end.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,500
But we know some volcanos have remained inactive for hundreds, even thousands, of years

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and then unexpectedly erupted again.
