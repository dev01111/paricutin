# Paricutín
## Location
In western Mexico, the volcano errupted over a small village in the state Michoacán of Mexico.
It destroyed the church (and more importantly, town) of ***San Juan Parangaricutiro*** which today has very little remains.
It is located 32km west-northwest of the Mexican city, ***Uruapan***. While not a major volcano in deaths, Paricutín is known all around the world.

## Activity (1943-1952)

It first started in February 20, 1943, and covered two whole villages in ash, the summary of that year was that the volcano had risen 450 metres above the base at the start of the year, and had completely buried Paricutíns village.

After the volcano errupted for the last time, it became extinct. Fast-forward to the future, 2022, it is now a local tourist attraction. It is an interesting site to see, so if you go to Mexico, check it out!
